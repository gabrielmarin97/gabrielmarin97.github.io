Hello! Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a young Mexican economist with research interests in macroeconomics, mostly public and international finance. In this page you can see publications, slides for my macro-policy and applied international macroeconomics courses, and photos I take that I find fun. Should you have any inquiries regarding my research, courses, or just to chat about life, do not hesitate to contact me.
