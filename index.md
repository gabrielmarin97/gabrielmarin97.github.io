Hello! Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a young Mexican economist with research interests in macroeconomics, mostly public and international finance. I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics from Universidad Anahuac and a master's degree in International Economics and Finance from Johns Hopkins University. Previously, I worked as a research fellow in the Inter-American Development Bank. Currently, I am a first year doctoral student at Arizona State University and I am a member of the Network on Welfare and Policy in Latin America and the Caribbean [WAPLAC](http://waplac.org/team/gabriel-marin). In this page you can see publications, slides for my macro-policy and applied international macroeconomics courses, and photos I take that I find fun. Should you have any inquiries regarding my research, courses, or just to chat about life, do not hesitate to contact me.
